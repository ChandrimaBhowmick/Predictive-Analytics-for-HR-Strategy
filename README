Project Name - Predictive Analytics for HR Strategy

In this project, we explore both predictive and descriptive methods to understand and forecast employee attrition using the IBM HR Analytics dataset. We developed three predictive models — C5.0, C&R Tree, and Linear Regression — to classify and score attrition likelihood. To complement this, we used Two-Step Clustering to uncover natural groupings in the workforce that may influence attrition. Our evaluation focuses on model performance metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, and ROC AUC) and cluster interpretation. This approach enables HR teams to not only predict attrition but also uncover behavioral patterns across employee groups, improving strategic retention planning.
